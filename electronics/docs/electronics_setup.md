# Sanity checks :


- 1. [Evaluation board] Code is customized for ON-ON-OFF. Check if the buttons are toggled appropriately
- 2. [Evaluation board] The jumper pin sockets must be connected for the following only : JP 6, JP 7, JP 3. All the others should be open
- 3. [Evaluation board] Make sure the encoder connection for a motor are connected to its corresponding connection on the evaluation board
- 4. Ensure that the connection between the board and the PC is oriented according to color - that H pin is connected to the CAN-H pin and the L pin is connected to the CAH-L pin. 
- 5. [Evaluation board] Encoder connection pin should have the green wire on its left
