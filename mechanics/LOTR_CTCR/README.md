# Concentric Tube Continuum Robot Prototype

Concentric tube continuum robots (CTCR) are a class of continuum robots.
A CTCR consists of multiple nested tubes that are concentric, pre-curved, and super-elastic. 
To generate a motion by changing the centerline of the nested tubes, each tube can be rotated and translated.
The rotational and translational motion can be generated by using two independent motors attached to a carriage. 
We refer to the survey by [Nwafor, Rabenorosoa et al. (T-RO 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2023.3255512) for a general overview on CTCRs.

We developed a torque-controlled CTCR with low complexity.

### Tubes

Note that we do not provide tubes.
In general, the flexible tubes are made of a Nitinol or made of thermoplastic materials in some instances. 
The material can be arbitrary as long as the elastic interaction between the tubes can be exploited.
For example

- Thermoplastic material [Amanov, Nguyen & Burgner-Kahrs (SPIE 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2081999) and [Morimoto & Okamura (T-RO 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2016.2602368)
- Nitinol [Sears & Dupont (IROS 2006)](https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2006.282072) and [Webster, Okamura & Cowan (IROS 2006)](https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2006.282073)

Further references are provided in [Nwafor, Rabenorosoa et al. (T-RO 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2023.3255512). 
    
We ordered our pre-curved Nitinol tubes from [Euroflex GmbH (Nuernberg, Germany)](https://www.euroflex.de/en/index.html).
