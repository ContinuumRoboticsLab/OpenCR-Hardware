# Learning Kit for Tendon-driven Continuum Robot Prototype

A tendon-driven continuum robot (TDCR) is composed of a flexible backbone along which tendons are guided using spacer disks, these last ones being fixed to the backbone. 
It is actuated by changing the tendonsâ€™ length and applying tendon tensions, which cause a reversible deformation of the backbone.
This one has one [type-II segment](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2022.873446/full) and three tendons.
