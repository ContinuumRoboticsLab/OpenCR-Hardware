# OpenCR-Hardware

Here we provide CAD design, component lists, assembly instructions, and software for you to create your continuum robot.
The prototypes, parts of them, and extensions can be used to build torque-controlled continuum robot prototypes.
A paper describing the actuation module and three different derived prototypes can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11850).

We took great inspiration from the [Open Dynamic Robot Initiative](https://open-dynamic-robot-initiative.github.io/), where efforts are made to build cost-efficient actuators for torque-controlled [legged robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00093) and [manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03596).
